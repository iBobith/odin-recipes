# odin-recipes
This project is the first official project I've received from the Odin Project. My goal is to make a simple, brutalist website, containing recipes and such. Knowing my current capabilities, I don't think it will be too hard - I wont be doing any css, since they have it planned for later in the course.

Afterthoughts: overall, the assignment wasnt too difficult. It gave me an oppertunity to refresh on my html skills, as well as create my own boilerplate, which I find quite handy, for future projects. Not much else to say, looks quite bad, since theres literally 0 css, but I've been told that we will return to this later in the course and make it pretty - will make an update then. (30/05/2023)

In the process of making this webpage something to be proud of, as well as it being a passion project for me - flaunting my love for the world of one piece and sharing this passion through creativity and hard work.
